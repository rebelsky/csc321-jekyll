Read chapter 1 and sections 10.1-10.2 of the SaaSbook.

Watch at least one SaaSbook video for those sections in "full attention"
mode.  You should only have the video on the screen.  You should have no
distractors.  You should have a notebook and writing utensil in hand.  You
may watch at whatever speed you consider appropriate.  (You'll watch the
videos on the MOOC.)

For the journal send an email message to me titled "**CSC 321 2018S,
Journal for Day 3 (*Your Name*)**" (without the quotation marks) and
with answers to the following questions.

1. Summarize in a sentence: How is the agile approach different from the
plan-and-document approach?

2. What surprised you the most in the SaaSbook material?  Why?

3. What are you most excited to learn more about later in the semester?
Why?

4. What point confused you the most?  Try to explain it in your own words.
