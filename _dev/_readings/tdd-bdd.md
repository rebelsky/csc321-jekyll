Journal for Day 8-FIXED (*Your Name*)**" (without the quotation marks) and
with answers to the following questions.

1. Find a Cucumber scenario for a Rails project.  You can look in
project codebases from previous iterations of this class, at the Cucumber 
Web sites, on Github, or wherever.

2. Describe the relationships between the various parts of the Cucumber
tests (the overview, the setup, the particular examples, the parsing code,
the code that does the work, and the Capybara support).

3. Suppose you didn't want to use Cucumber.  How else might you prepare
to use BDD?

4. What's the most confusing part of BDD/Cucumber?  Explain it in
your own words.

5. How does Fox and Patterson's presentation of test-driven development
compare to your prior experiences with unit testing?

6. Choose the most confusing idea from 8.2 - 8.6. Make a serious attempt
to explain this idea in your own words. What questions remain?

7. Choose the most confusing idea from 8.7 - 8.9. Make a serious attempt
to explain this idea in your own words. What questions remain?

8. What do you see as the relationship(s) between BDD and TDD?  

9. What do you see as the most important or enduring concept in this
chapter overall?
