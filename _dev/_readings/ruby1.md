Read sections 3.1-3.4 of the SaaSbook (a.k.a. _Engineering Software as
a Service_) and then answer the following questions.

1. You have learned Ruby in three ways: Through an online tutorial, through
narrative in a textbook, and through writing slightly more open-ended code.  
In what way did each approach help your learning?  In what way did each approach
hinder your learning?

2. In your own words, explain what "Duck Typing" is.

3. What is something interesting and new that you have learned about Ruby?

For the journal send an email message to me titled "**CSC 321 2018S,
Journal for Class 4 (*Name*)**" (without the quotation marks) and with
answers to those questions in the body of the email.
