# Reading: {{page.title}}

1. Read sections 7.1-7.5 of the SaaSbook.

2. Watch at least one SaaSbook video for those sections in "full attention"
mode.  You should only have the video on the screen.  You should have no
distractors.  You should have a notebook and writing utensil in hand.  You
may watch at whatever speed you consider appropriate.

3. Review chapters 2 and 4 of the SaaSbook, focusing primarily on the
concept of "Software as a Service".

4. Read Richard Stallman's "Who does that server really serve?", available
online at <https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/who-does-that-server-really-serve.en.html>.

For the journal send an email message to me titled "**CSC 321 2017F,
Journal for Day 7 (*Your Name*)**" (without the quotation marks) and
with answers to the following questions.

1. If you are in a CSC 322 project group, write two user stories on your
project.  (Each member of that group must write two stories.)  If you are
not in a CSC 322 project group, write two user stories for a four-year
planner service that allows Grinnell students and faculty to collaborate
on building four-year plans.

2. What confused you the most about the reading on user stories?  Explain
the issue as best you can.

3. Fox/Patterson and Stallman provide very different views on Software
as a Service.  Quickly explain which you prefer and why.
