# {{ page.title }}

Read the introduction to chapter 2 and Sections 2.1 to 2.4 of the SaaSbook.

For the journal send an email message to me titled "**{{ site.courseid
}} {{ site.semester }} Journal for Day {{ page.day }} (*Your Name*)**"
(without the quotation marks) and with answers to the following questions.

1. List five different technologies (i.e., languages, protocols) involved
in the Web and their general purpose.

2. If you could choose a topic related to the reading or the Web for me
to spend about 1/3 of class on, what would that topic be?  (I'll look for
common or interesting suggestions and struture the class around those
suggestions.)
