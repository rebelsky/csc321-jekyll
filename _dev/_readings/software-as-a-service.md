1. Skim chapters 2 and 4 of the SaaSbook, focusing primarily on the
concept of "Software as a Service".

2. Read Richard Stallman's "Who does that server really serve?", available
online at <https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/who-does-that-server-really-serve.en.html>.

For the journal send an email message to me titled "**CSC 321 2017F,
Journal for Day 7 (*Your Name*)**" (without the quotation marks) and
with answers to the following questions.

1. Explain, in your own words, what "Software as a Service" is.

2. Fox/Patterson and Stallman provide very different views on Software
as a Service.  Quickly explain which you prefer and why.
