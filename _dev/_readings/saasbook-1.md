An introduction to software engineering
=======================================

Read chapter 1 and sections 10.1-10.2 of the SaaSbook.

Watch at least one SaaSbook video for those sections in "full attention"
mode.  You should only have the video on the screen.  You should have no
distractors.  You should have a notebook and writing utensil in hand.  You
may watch at whatever speed you consider appropriate.
