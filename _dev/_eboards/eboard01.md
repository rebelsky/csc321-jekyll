### An atypical start to class.

* Welcome back!
* We have a guest speaker today.  I'll give the class to her when
  she arrives and then resume when she finishes.

### News / Etc.

  teach you again.
    * But I will still take attendance.
* As seems to be the case way too often, the course Web site is not quite
  in the state I'd like.  Cross your fingers that it will be working 
  better soon.

### Upcoming Work

* [Sign up for way too many accounts](../assignments/accounts), due Tuesday.
* [Learn some Ruby](../assignments/getting-started-with-ruby), also due
  Tuesday.
* [Read and report about Ruby](../readings/ruby1), also due Tuesday.

### Questions

Guest lecture
-------------

**Welcome to Megan Goering!**

* Class of 2008.
* Getting old.
* Lives in San Francisco, which is not the same as Topeka Kansas.
* Megan didn't know Sam in college.  Their lives are worse because of that.
* But they've gotten to know each other since, and their lives are better.
* Debt is scary, but you can do it.
* Left Grinnell to investigate fraud.  Boy, it was depressing.  But she
  was successful.  Wrote a 2000 page paper (using Grinnell skills, that
  took only two days) (no not really).  Saw the evil of Wall Street.
* Wanted to do tech, but worried that she did not have a tech background.
  Amazingly, other skill sets are necessary at big tech companies, and
  people who are just code monkeys are, well, just code monkeys.  
* Grinnellian != Code Monkey
* Technology is cool because you build things and enact change.
* And it requires people with wide varieties of backgrounds.
* So she told all of this to her short course prof, who said "go for it".
* The prof decided to hire her for his venture capital firm.
* They like to get returns on some rolls of the dice.  It requires lots
  of analyzing people.
* Funding people who change the world is not nearly as good as changing the
  world.  (Sam notes that teaching people who will change the world can
  be fulfilling.)
* Went to Google.  Spent four years there.  Started at tech support.
  Thought she would deal with feedback and do something about it.
* Most of what you believe breaks down in the physics of reality.
* Made bet - All these folks want to do tech.  Google will need someone
  with other skills to work them.  Ran TC teams in El Salvador, Montreal,
  other countries.  Grew them all.
* Google does "smart phone routing" based on your role, your language,
  the time of day, your level of experience.  Certainly beats stupid
  phone trees.  
    * "There is so much computing, even in the non-technical side of
      computing."
* Learned a bunch.  Ran the biggest TC corps her little Grinnell heart
  could imagine.
* Detour: Stopped union busting in one job.
* In 2015 decided to start her own business.  Human-centered design,
  design thinking, etc.
* Thinking about working with folks: Who, What do they bring, What
  do they do or experience, what do they leave with, what are their
  core needs, core benefits
* Breaking into groups brings insights.
* Functional and problem solving models can make a big difference.
* We can use it on political issues, too.
* Helps us address complex problems.
* It all comes from Design Thinking and Human-Centered Design
* Time to play in a really short format.

Human centered design activity

* Five steps
    * Empathize
    * Define
    * Ideate (separately in parallel) about 60-90 seconds
        * I bet this frustrates JDS
        * We do this in parallel to stop group think
    * Prototype - Simple model; can be sketchy (but not sketchy like
      Grinnell alums can be sketchy).  Quick and dirty.
    * Test - Get in front of people to get information.
* We will do these really fast to understand.
* Note: The process does well at both good and bad ideas.
* Look for best (B), craziest (C), impossible (I).
* Brainstorm ideas of things you might want to build.
* Each group chooses an idea that they like.
    * Sample idea: Chopsticks for people who did not grow up with chopsticks.
      "How do I pick up that damn rice at the hot new Asian Fusion restaurant
      without looking like a total idiot?"
* Identify a user group (for your idea).
    * Sample user group: People who need cuddling.
* If someone in your user group identifies with that group, share
  as much as you know about that user.  Otherwise come up with things
  you know and what questions you have.
     * ...
* Fast forward (we would normally go back and empathize and defie
  and gain).  
    * Sample revision: Those folks who are eating at Asian Fusion restaurants
      are pretentious and engaging in cultural appropriation in any case,
      so we want to educate them.
    * Sample revision: Really, what we're thinking about is making it fun to
      wait for your food at the restaurant
* By empathising with your user you better create something that they will 
  like.
* Prototyping.  Think about where your thing will arrive in their life.
  At what moment in time will the person you are serving encounter your
  innovation?  What would they discover?  What would you send in to
  that moment?  (E.g., ad pops up, server hands them, friend mentions it.)
* Insert arbitrary constraints: Choose something!
* Then build a prototype.
* Reference: Ontological Designing (more details forthcoming)

What is CSC 321?
----------------

* A course in software design - How you build medium to large-scale  
  projects in a team using some consistent methodologies and approaches
* An introduction to or extension of a variety of tools you will use
  as you build software.
    * Ruby on Rails
       * Ruby is a programming language designed to be convenient for
         quickly writing useful programs
       * Rails is a framework for building Web applications, most
         typically with Ruby
       * "Convention over configuration"
   * Version control software (Git)
   * Task management (Trello)
   * Cloud development (c9)
   * Application deployment (Heroku)
   * Basic things CS students should know, but don't necessary (HTML, CSS)
* Preparation for CSC 322, the practicum part of our software design
  curriculum
 
What do we learn in this course?
--------------------------------

*Modified think->pair->share.*

* Make a list of five topics that you would expect to see in 
  "A course in software design - How you build medium to large-scale  
  projects in a team using some consistent methodologies and approaches."
* In groups of three, share your answers with each other.
    * This is an opportunity to make sure that all of you talk.
    * This is an opportunity to make sure that we get a variety of
      ideas heard.
* Share your answers with the broader group.
* I will record the answers as best I can.

### Practices

* Documentation
* Testing 
    * Test Driven Design 
    * Behavior Driven Development
    * Unit testing
    * Integration testing
    * Testing frameworks
* Core methodologies
    * Agile programming
    * Waterfall programming

### Design Principles

* Core OOD
    * Make things more readable and more reusable (maybe more efficient).
    * Encapsulation
        * Limit access to certain parts of the system to make it easier
          to change those parts
        * Group related things together to make it easier to cooperate.
    * Inheritance
        * Define one class in terms of another (e.g., "Dogs are a type
          of animal, so we can automatically inherit all of the key
          methods of animal, such as move.")
    * Polymorphism, Parametric
        * When two objects or classes provide the same operations, you
          can write functions that use either.
        * `public interface Addable { Addable add(Addable other); }`
        * `Addable double(Addable a) { return a.add(a); }`
    * Polymorphism, Structural
        * E.g. generic types `public class List<T>`
* Design patterns - MVC

### Group work

* Assessing group strengths and opportunities (and weaknesses)
  [May happen more in CSC 322]
* Roles that we have in a project team.  (information)
* Delegation - How do I get my teammates to do the work for me? (a bit)
* Clients - Assessing needs
    * User stories - a semi-formal way to document the needs your client
      has.

### Problems (or Opportunities)

* Legacy code
* Planning for the long term

### Miscellaneous

* Some database stuff

Why CSC 321?
------------

*That is, why are you here?*

Course structure
----------------

"Could you please explain the hour this class meets and what the workload
is?"

* First half of the semester, CSC 321 meets 8:00-9:50 a.m. TuTh
* Second half of the semester, CSC 321 does not meet
* First half of the semester, CSC 322 meets 10:00-10:50 a.m. TuTh
* Second half of the semester, CSC 322 meets 8:00-10:50 a.m. TuTh

A half semester, two credit class is supposed to consume approximately
twelve hours per week.  Four hours per week in class; eight hours per
week out of class on homework and reading.

Homework is timeboxed.  If you work the eight hours *and document it*, you
get at least 90% on the homework.
