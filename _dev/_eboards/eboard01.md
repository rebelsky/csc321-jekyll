Preliminaries
-------------

### Admin

* *Welcome back!*  I think I know most of you, and I'm happy to be able to
  teach you again.
* But I'm still taking attendance.
* The course site for CSC 321 may be more ready than it's ever been.
  Cross your fingers that it stays that way.  Let me know when things
  don't work.  
    * For example, we had a configuration screwup that made some pages
      unavailable.  Let me know if you find such pages.
* There will probably not be a separate CSC 322 next year.  If you 
  are taking CSC 321 this semester, please enroll in CSC 322.
* Please fill out the Data Buddies survey that you received over break.
  <https://cerp.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_3UH7q6TmdZ8YRPD>.
  Surveys are more meaningful if we get higher participation.
* After today, I'll plan to have a cart of laptops in this classroom.

### Upcoming work

* [Set up way too many accounts](../assignments/accounts) (Due LAST NIGHT)
* [Learn Ruby](../assignments/ruby-codecademy) (Due 10:30 pm TUESDAY)
* [Read chapter 1 + sections 10.1--10.2 of the SaaSBook](../readings/saasbook1)
  (Due 8:00 Thursday)

### Good things to do (Academic)

* CS table tomorrow: Plan topics
* MLK day (+ 1 week + 1 day) event, Tuesday, 7:00 pm, JRC 101
* CS extras Thursday: Summer research opportunities in CS.

### Questions

What is CSC 321?
----------------

* A course in software design - How you build medium to large-scale  
  projects in a team using some consistent methodologies and approaches
    * We will focus on agile methodologies
* An introduction to or extension of a variety of tools you will use
  as you build software.
    * Ruby on Rails
    * Version control software (Git)
    * Task management (Trello)
    * Cloud development (c9)
    * Application deployment (Heroku)
    * Also some things CS students should know, but don't 
      necessarily know (HTML, CSS, Web struture)
* Preparation for CSC 322, the practicum part of our software design
  curriculum
* Also some opportunity to deal with uncertainty.  Not all of the answers
  will be in the readings; you'll have to do some Web searches,
  particularly when things go wrong.

Course goals
------------

_Given that overall structure, what do you expect to see covered in
this course?  What do you want to see covered in this course?_

Modified "think->pair->share"

* Make a list of five topics.
* In groups of approximately three, share your answers with each other.
    * This is an opportunity to make sure that all of you talk.
    * This is an opportunity to make sure that we get a variety of
      ideas heard.
* We will then share with the larger course.

"Soft skills"

* How to work with a client.  Done in CSC 322.
* Collaboration: How do you work with a group of people.
     * Consistent formatting of code.
     * Communication.
     * Divide tasks.
     * And more.

Key ideas

* Version control
    * To share code with teammates and other people.
    * To allow you to safely make changes
    * To keep track of your work and why you made the changes you did
* User interfaces
    * How to design them and make them meaningful
    * User interaction, too
    * Maybe a bit about accessibility
    * At least a bit about making things "pretty"
    * No deep UI stuff, though.  We have a separate course
* Test-driven design
    * You should not be confident in your code unless you test it
    * You should probably write the tests *first*
* Dealing with structured data and the use of databases to organize
  those data.
* How do you deal with legacy code.
* Good documentation practices.
    * Look back to 151 for individual procedures.
    * Most people challenge that approach.

Experiences

* What Sam said about struggling through situations in which there
  isn't a clear answer.
* Dealing with legacy code. (in CSC 322)

Why this course?
----------------

_Why are you taking this course?_

* Same process, slightly faster.

Course structure
----------------

* Seven week course, three days per week.
* During this half of the semester, you are expected to do about twelve
  hours per week on this class.
* That's about nine hours outside of class.
    * Assignments (mostly programming).  Mostly Rails, all from Hartl
      (The Rails Tutorial).  Five hours
    * Readings (mostly from the SaaSbook).  Required journals due the
      night before class at 8 pm.  Four hours
* You may timebox!


Work time (if there's time)
