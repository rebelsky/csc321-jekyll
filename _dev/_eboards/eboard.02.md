====================================================

_Overview_

* Preliminaries.
    * Admin.
    * Upcoming Work.
    * Questions.
* Ruby
* Some Ruby Problems

Preliminaries
-------------

### Admin

Notes

* We now have a schedule in place.  The rest of the syllabus should be
  there tonight.
* I lied.  Most students last year said they took 4-5 hours.  That
  means I've used about half of your homework time for this week
  (assuming that you got through everything).
* How long did the Ruby thing take?

Homework

* More Ruby (soon to appear in assignments)
* Reading journal (in assignments)

Good Things To Do

Some Ruby Problems
------------------

*We did not get to this section.  You are likely to do it in homework.*

Write `sums_to_n?(vals,val)` that returns true if any two distinct
values from `vals` (a list of values) sums to `val`.

* `sums_to_n?([1,2,7],5)` -> false
* `sums_to_n?([1,2,7],3)` -> true
* `sums_to_n?([1,2,7],8)` -> true
* `sums_to_n?([1,2,7],9)` -> true
* `sums_to_n?([1,2,7],4)` -> false

Write `multiple_of_4?(bitstring)` that takes a string of 0's and 1's
(representing an unsigned integer) as input and returns true if the
string represents an integer divisible by four.

Write `starts_with_consonant?(str)` that determines if a string
starts with a consonant.
