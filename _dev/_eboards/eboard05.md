Preliminaries
-------------

### Admin

* Fruit snax!
* Apologies for being behind in grading.  I have a busy next 
  few days, but I will do my best to catch up over the weekend.
* Last reminder: If you have TuTh afternoons available for the next few
  weeks, you should consider Megan Goering's "Design Thinking" course.
* Many of you received comments that you should be more thorough on your
  journal answers.  Here's an appropriate length one for part 1 of t he
  latest journal:
  _DNS (Domain Name System) -- The Domain Name System matches hostnames to IP addresses so that a browser user does not have to remember the IP addresses of each site they want to visit. The browser asks a DNS server where a given hostname is, and then receives an IP address that refers to the same place._.

### Upcoming work

* [Hartl 1](../assignments/hartl-1) due Thursday at 10:30pm.
    * This should be less time-consuming than the Ruby exercises.
* [Hartl 2](../assignments/hartl-2) due Sunday at 10:30pm.
    * This should take about the same amount of time as the first
      Hartl assignment.
