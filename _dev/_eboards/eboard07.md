  sexual assault, animals, hunger, health, volunteering, and four-year
  planning.  Please feel free to leave the room at any point if you find

Project work time
-----------------

I couldn't get it to deploy to Heroku.  I skipped that step.
  : Knowing how to deploy is important.  Ask for help.

Wow, minor things cause big problems!
  : Yup, we've talked about that before.
  : Context is important.  Execute commands in the correct directory.
  : Executing (or failing to execute) prior commands, a current command
    may/may not work.

I have no idea why I'm getting an error?
  : If you see a "nil, no such method" error, it means that you haven't
    assigned a value to a variable that you are using.
  : Think more carefully about program logic.

What are the big-picture issues you saw?
  : It's hard to program when you don't have immediate help available.
    But that's something you have to learn.
  : You need to ask questions of others.
  : The steps are important.

SaaS
----

_Note: Your most common response is that Stallman is an idealist and
most people have to deal with compromises._

* What is it?
* Why do some folks like it?
* Why do some folks dislike it?

User stories
------------

_What are they?_

* A way of describing the goals of our project, primarily from the user's
  perspective.

How do we represent them?  

* Feature: A general name for what we are trying to achieve
* Actor (As _this-kind-of-user_)
* Goal (So that I can _something I want to achieve_)
* Action (I want to be able to _do this_)
* Examples - Help make sure that we all understand the Actor/Goal/Action
  triplet.

Sample example

* Suppose our database includes the following entries

        Rebelsky        Fall 2017       CSC 321 01      2
        Rebelsky        Fall 2017       CSC 322 01      2
        Rebelsky        Fall 2017       CSC 301 01      4
        ...

* When I go to the "total teaching load" page, select "Rebelsky", and
  click "Compute", I should see ...

Why do we have them?

* Communicate with the user
* Stories provide an opening point for discussions.  "If this is your
  goal, couldn't we also achieve it this way?"  "Why are you doing this?"
* Lets us prioritize

Making user stories SMART
-------------------------

Here's one way to think about user stories

* Specific
* Measurable
* Achievable
* Relevant
* Time-Boxed

Here's another, taken from <http://agileforall.com/new-to-agile-invest-in-good-user-stories/>

* Independent
* Negotiable
* Valuable
* Estimable
* Small
* Testable

Your stories
------------

### Stories to discuss

#### Unknown project: 

* Display a page to the user with a title

Problems

* Not specific
* Not necessarly applicable
* Not a known user base.

#### Project PALS: Add a posting system for car pool services for those without personal transportation to get to PALS

* As a volunteer,
* So that I can volunteer at PALS without worrying about how to get to the animal shelter,
* I want to add a posting system so that any volunteer with a car can volunteer to pick people up or drop them off. 

Fixes

* Needs to better express what actions you'd like to do.
* "I want to be able to indicate that I need a ride and be notified at
  least one day in advance if that ride is available."
* Might also add: "I want my shift cancelled and me to be notified at
  least one day in advance if that ride is not available"

#### Callisto: Untitled

* As a survivor, 
* I want to have different methods of reporting my case. It should be either a voice recording, call for Grinnell Advocates or other national hotlines, text typed on a computer, or a picture of documents written on paper 
* So that I can report with the least trouble

Problem

* Too complex.  Needs simplification (multiple cases).
* Also needs story of "I can retrieve it later."

#### Callisto: Proving confidentiality of sexual assault report

* As a sexual assault survivor
* So that I can feel comfortable reporting the assault
* I want to be able to know that my report will be confidential until I choose to release it

Problem

* Needs measuring.

#### Callisto: Untitled

* As a school official, 
* I want to see the analytics of sexual assaults reported on campus (where, when, how) without seeing the victims or perpetrator's name, 
* so that I can adjust campus policy accordingly to minimize these incidents

NO NO NO NO NO

I am a member of the Mayflower community who has been staying with my son
for 4 months as I prepared for his wedding. I am getting ready to head
back to the community and I would like to see if there are new faces
