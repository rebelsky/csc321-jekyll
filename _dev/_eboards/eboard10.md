Preliminaries
-------------

### News and notes

* I brought food.
* Alumni mentors visit Wednesday.  Please try to clear lunch time,
  4pm for their talk, (and 1pm, if possible).
* We'll talk about code smells and legacy code in a few weeks.  I may
  bring the code I had to work with this weekend.  I spent over four
  hours tracking down a bug (in part because it was so badly designed).
* I *think* I've fixed the schedule.
     * Links are to eboards rather than outlines.  (Future links don't work.)
     * Changed due dates of assignments.
* Mentor sessions Tuesday and Thursday.

### Upcoming work

    * I still need to find a three-hour block to write that assignment.
    * Python people should find an alternative.
    * You will have time to work on it on Monday.
* [Hartl 6](../assignments/hartl-6) due **Next Tuesday** at 10:30pm.
