### Questions

The subject matter of the class
-------------------------------

_Chat with the person next to you and come up with about three items
for each of the following._

Software design principles - What are principles that help you build 
good software?  Software design practices - Primarily agile.

* Agile - Pair, refactoring, short sprints, client-focused, ...
* DRY - A way of thinking about your code.  (More generally, smells
  and ways to address them.)
* Patterns, particularly MVC, as a way of thinking about the architecture
  of programs.
* BDD and TDD - Approaching software development by thinking about
  capabilities.
* Testing - Why - Good software, understand legacy software,
  think about your goals in detail, free you to make changes.
* Acronyms: SOLID, SOFA, ...
* User stories
* ...

Tools, particularly Ruby and Rails.

* Ruby
* Rails
* Rspec for testing
* Cucumber for user stories
* Heroku as a place for deployment
* C9: Developing in the cloud rather than on your own laptop (or on a MathLAN
  workstation)
* Git - deeper understanding of workflow and such
* SQL, at least a bit
* UML

Bigger picture issues

* "I can learn stuff without a textbook or teacher providing all the
  information."
* Feedback from your team and from the software is helpful.  Work in
  systems in which you can get feedback.
* Ethics
* Learn a bit about new technologies quickly.
* Sometimes you have to work at a high enough level that you just trust
  that things underneath work without understanding them.

Apologies
---------

* Too large.
* Sam took on too much teaching responsibility.
* Wrong format.
* Switch back to the textbook.

Course evaluations
------------------

You know the drill.

Quick Debrief: Class
--------------------

* Would it work to have 321 + 322 + 322 in one semester?  Need is unclear.
* Should I go back to Hartl?  Probably.  There's not really enough material
  to support the Rotten Potatoes stuff.  The Rotten potatoes stuff needs
  more context.
    * Why Cucumber?  It's probably a bad idea.  Let's switch to RSpec
      or whatever.
* Something in between would be nice.
* Three hours straight on Tuesday/Thursday morning (bad idea).  Two
  hour chunks would be better.
* Notify us in advance that there's an electronic version of the SaaSbook
  and that the electronic version is preferred.  
* Use the SaaSbook only for software design, and probably look for another
  textbook.

Debrief on Alumni Visits
------------------------

* Useful advice: Use popular gems - Confidence that they work as intended,
  don't have security flaws, and likely have good documentation and a
  support community.
* Useful advice: Use gems, rather than building stuff yourself.
* Useful advice: Look at how recently things have been updated (programs,
  documentation)
* Stable is often better than cutting edge
* Beyond coding: Your first job is not your career, you will probably move.
* Beyond CS: Grinnell remains your home
* Tools to use: RSpec or Minitest, rather than Cucumber
* They are an exciting, good, resource.
