A brief introduction to Ruby
----------------------------

Some Ruby exercises
-------------------

*We will explore some of the examples from today's assignment to see
the different ways in which students approached problems.*

Write `sums_to_n?(vals,val)` that returns true if any two distinct
values from `vals` (a list of values) sums to `val`.

Write `multiple_of_4?(bitstring)` that takes a string of 0's and 1's
(representing an unsigned integer) as input and returns true if the
string represents an integer divisible by four.

Write `starts_with_consonant?(str)` that determines if a string
starts with a consonant.

Additional characteristics of Ruby
