Syllabus
========

Welcome to {{ site.courseid }}! The official course description for this
course is:

> Provides a foundation for "programming in the large" and developing
high-quality software that meets human needs. Introduces the software
lifecycle, agile development methods, professional tools, and software
design principles. Includes hands-on laboratory work.

In other words, we help you learn the basics of software design and
software engineering.

Course Format
------------

This course is being offered in a non-traditional format.  We will
be relying on a MOOC and some online materials as part of the core
"textbooks" for the course.  We can then spend class time more on
discussion and problem-solving based on the readings and videos from
the MOOC.  (Some people would call this a "flipped classroom.")

This is also a course in which you should be developing professional
skills and habits.  Hence, some of the work in the class will require
you to do exploration on your own.  The College would probably call
this an opportunity to "learn how to learn".  When you are stuck, I
recommend that you follow the strategy of [you must try, and then you must
ask](https://blogs.akamai.com/2013/10/you-must-try-and-then-you-must-ask.html).

Historical evidence suggests that what you get out of the course depends
on what you put into it.

The course meets three days per week for the first seven weeks of the
semester.  Note that this semester marks the fourth or fifth different
scheduling model we have tried for the course.  You are expected to do
about nine hours of work outside of class each week.  You may timebox
the programmign part of that work.

Learning goals
--------------

By the end of this course,  you should be able to

* apply agile software development methodology, tools, and practices
  in real-world team projects;
* contrast agile software development methodology with plan-and-document
  methodologies;
* build SaaS applications with the Ruby on Rails framework; and
* apply techniques for understanding and modifying legacy code.

Accommodations and adjustments
------------------------------

Please read [my policy on accommodations and adjustments]({{ site.baseurl }}/handouts/accommodations) and [my statement on accessibility]({{ site.baseurl }}/handouts/accessibility).

Important warnings
------------------

*Warning!* The Berkeley CS 169 course that forms the underpinnings of
this course keeps changing.

*Warning!* I continue to use Web tools that with which I am not completely
familiar (e.g., edX, Jekyll).  When things look wrong on this site or
the edX site, please notify me ASAP.  I may not always be able to fix
things, but I will try.

*Warning!* Some students prefer readings.  Some prefer videos.
You should try both.

*Warning!* We continue to try new structures for the course.  It feels a bit
compressed to me, but I think we can fit everything in.

Grading
-------

*These policies are likely to change.*

* __Class participation__: 20%.  Much of class time is in discussion.
  I will evaluate you on the quality of your contributions.
* __Journal__: 40%.  Following the lead of Davis and Weinman, I
  ask you to do a journal assignment after each reading, video, and/or
  tutorial.  Journals are generally due at 8:00 p.m. on the night before
  class to give me time to reflect on them before class.
* __Homework__: 40%.  These are timeboxed.  If you spend the required
  time and document your efforts, you will get a minimum of 90% on
  a homework assignment.  Homeworks will be due every few days.

The grading scale for this course will be:

<dl class="dl-horizontal">
  <dt>A</dt> <dd>94&ndash;100%</dd>
  <dt>A-</dt><dd>90&ndash;93%</dd>
  <dt>B+</dt><dd>87&ndash;89%</dd>
  <dt>B</dt> <dd>84&ndash;86%</dd>
  <dt>B-</dt><dd>80&ndash;83%</dd>
  <dt>C+</dt><dd>77&ndash;79%</dd>
  <dt>C</dt> <dd>74&ndash;76%</dd>
  <dt>D</dt> <dd>60&ndash;69%</dd>
  <dt>F</dt> <dd>0&ndash;60%</dd>
</dl>

You may note that there are some gaps between ranges.  I reserve the right to make decisions about which direction to "round" values in those gaps. I also reserve the right to adjust this scale during the semester. You will be notified of any changes, and the scale will not change in the final two weeks of the course. You may ask me for your current grade in the class at any point; I will happily give you my best estimate based on the current scale and graded work so far, but *these estimates are not guarantees of a specific final grade*.

Attendance
----------

Your classmates and partners depend on your contributions to learn new
material and complete the required work for this course. *Don't let them
down!* You are expected to arrive on time and actively participate in
every class.

Because your participation is so important, I will not grant excused
absences except in particular and exceptional circumstances. I will deduct
2% from your final grade for each absence and 1% for each time you are
late to class. These deductions are doubled if you do not send me a short
note on the day of the absence or late attendance, preferably in advance
(e.g., "I will be unable to make it to class today" or "I apologize for
missing class today" or "Another instructor has asked that I meet with
them immediately after class; I expect that I'll be about ten minutes
late.")  I allot each student a 2% "penalty buffer," so you may miss
one class or arrive late twice (if you send a note).  This policy is
intended to give you the flexibility to deal with or personal or other
issues (including job interviews) that require you to miss class.

I realize that there are a number of reasonable and expected absences.
These include athletic events, academic conferences, course trips,
and religious observations.  Such absences do not count as unexecused
absences provided you notify me of them at least one week in advance.

If you are ill, I would prefer that you rest and get better rather than
attend class.  

I realize that some disabilities may require you to miss class.  Ideally,
these requirements are documented in your accommodations form.  But I
will do my best to make adjustments and accommodations in all cases.

If your are sick, *please do not come to class.*  I
would prefer that you reset and get better.  Please seek
medical care as needed. [Student Health and Counseling Services
(SHACS)](https://www.grinnell.edu/about/offices-services/student-health)
offers health and mental health services to students.  I excuse illness
provided you notify me the day of class, preferably in advance of class.
I do not require a note from SHACS or your doctor.  Note, however, if
you are ill more than a few times, I may discuss the issue with student
affairs and may stop excusing illness-based absences.

Participation
-------------

Because much of our work in this course involves collaboration and discussion, you will be evaluated on your participation.
Participating in class involves:

* being present in class (physically and mentally)
* coming to class on time
* coming to class prepared
* asking questions when appropriate
* making positive contributions to class discussion by volunteering and when called upon
* staying on task during lab exercises, and
* working effectively with your partner(s)

Students who regularly meet these criteria can expect to earn an A- for
their participation grade. I will reward students who regularly provide
significant insights or guide discussion in productive ways with a higher
participation score. Students who fail to participate regularly (e.g.,
demonstrating a lack of preparation or involvement during lab exercises)
or who participate in counterproductive ways (e.g., by dominating the
conversation, making inappropriate comments, or getting off-task) can
expect to earn a lower score.

Workload
--------

Here's an approximate breakdown of how you will likely spend your
time each week.

* Class time (3 hours)
* Readings/videos/journaling (4 hours)
* Programming and writing assignments (5 hours)

The first week may be a bit busier as you get set up.  However, I've made
the workload a bit lighter in the first week of CSC 322 to accommodate
for the potential extra workload in CSC 321.

Communication
-------------

Dr. Davis created a Slack team for general discussion of CSC
321/2.  Join it here: <https://grinnell-sw.slack.com/>.  There is a
`#homework` channel for discussion of homework assignments.  Please
consider using Slack.

Development
-----------

The course designers recommend that we do
development on Cloud 9.  Instructions are at
<https://github.com/saasbook/courseware/wiki/Setting-up-Cloud9>.

Books and other readings
------------------------

[The CSC 321 Course Web](index.html)

> The hypertext that you are currently reading.  Right now, it looks like
it will primarily contain my notes for each class (outlines) and my record
of each class (eboards), but we'll see.

Fox, Armando and Patterson, David (2016). _Engineering Software as a
Service: An Agile Approach Using Cloud Computing_, latest edition.

> Our core textbook.  Fox and Patterson synthesized a lot of ideas
to produce a textbook that grounds software engineering principles in
a new model of computing.  This textbook is rapidly evolving.
I would recommend that you purchase the Kindle edition through Amazon,
particularly since they are updating the textbook again this semester.
(With the Kindle Cloud Reader, available at <https://read.amazon.com/>
or an appropriate app, you should be able to read the book on any
electronic device.)

> The underlying MOOC.  You can use this MOOC for videos that correspond
to the various readings.  There are also many other resources available
on the MOOC.

Academic honesty
----------------

Please read [my policies on academic honesty]({{ site.baseurl }}/handouts/academic-honesty) and [the CS department's academic honesty policy](https://www.cs.grinnell.edu/academic-honesty-policy).  I expect you to sign and return the latter.

Extra credit
------------

Although I regularly offer extra credit in my four-credit courses, I do
not offer extra credit in two-credit courses.  Nonetheless, I will still
recommend academic, artistic, cultural, and peer events on campus.

Citations
---------

Many parts of this overview, as well as the overall design of the course, are
due to Janet Davis.  I have reused materials with her permission.

Much of the original design of this site comes from Charlie Curtsinger. 
I've since made a variety of changes.
