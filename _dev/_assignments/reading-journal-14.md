Reading journal for class 14
============================

For the journal send an email message to me titled "**CSC 321 2017S,
Journal for Day 14 (*Your Name*)**" (without the quotation marks) and
with answers to the following questions.

1. Find a Cucumber scenario for a Rails project.  You can look in
project codebases from previous iterations of this class, at the Cucumber 
Web sites, on Github, or wherever.

2.Describe the relationships between the various parts of the Cucumber
tests (the overview, the setup, the particular examples, the parsing
code, the code that does the work, and the Capybara support).

3. Suppose you didn't want to use Cucumber.  How else might you prepare
to use BDD?

4. What's the most confusing part of BDD/Cucumber?  Explain it in
your own words.
