Reading journal for class 4
===========================

For the journal send an email message to me titled "**CSC 321 2017S, Journal
for Day 4 (*Your Name*)**" and with answers to the following questions.

1. Hartl presents a lot of information in chapter 1.  What would you put
in a short "cheat sheet" of things you need to remember?

2. Hartl gives a short introduction to the Model-View-Controller pattern.
Do a bit more Web research on MVC and then summarize (a) what the pattern
is and (b) why it's useful.
