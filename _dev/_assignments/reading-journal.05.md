Reading journal for class 5
===========================

For the journal send an email message to me titled "**CSC 321 2017S, Journal
for Day 5 (*Your Name*)**" and with answers to the following questions.

1. What do you see as advantages and disadvantages of using scaffolding.

2. Pick three files created by the scaffold command (files that Hartl
doesn't describe) and do your best to describe them.

3. What is the most puzzling part of chapter 2.
