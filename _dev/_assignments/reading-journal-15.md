with answers to the following questions.

1. How does Fox and Patterson's presentation of test-driven development

2. Choose the most confusing idea from 8.2 - 8.6. Make a serious attempt
to explain this idea in your own words. What questions remain?

4. What do you see as the relationship(s) between BDD and TDD?  Which
