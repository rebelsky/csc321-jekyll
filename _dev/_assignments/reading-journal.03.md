Reading journal for class 3
===========================

For the journal send an email message to me titled "**CSC 321 2017S, Journal
for Day 3 (*Your Name*)**" and with answers to the following questions.

* You have learned Ruby in three ways: Through an online tutorial, through text in the SaaSbook, and through videos for the MOOC associated with the SaaSbook.  Which modes seem best for you, and why?
* What's something interesting and new you've learned about Ruby.
* What was your experience with the autograder like?
