===========================

For the journal send an email message to me titled "**CSC 321 2017S,
Journal for Day 7 (*Your Name*)**" (without the quotation marks) and
with answers to the following questions.

1. Summarize in a sentence: How is the agile approach different from the
   plan-and-document approach?

2. What surprised you the most in the SaaSbook material?  Why?

3. What are you most excited to learn more about later in teh semester?
Why?

4. What point confused you the most?  Try to explain it in your own words.
