1. You should have received an invitation to join Cloud 9
(<https://c9.io>).  Accept that invitation.  Note that you can
create only one private workspace on Cloud 9; use that only for
your community project.  It's fine if you do your homework in a
public workspace.

2. Please set up accounts with the following services.

    a. <https://github.com> - Version control 

    b. <https://bitbucket.org> - Version control

    c. <https://www.edx.org> - MOOC

    d. <https://grinnell-sw.slack.com> - Communication

    e. <https://www.codecademy.com> - Learning

    f. <https://trello.com> - Task management

    g. <https://www.heroku.com> - Deploy rails apps

    h. <https://www.awseducate.com/Registration> - AWS cloud services

3. Message me on the course slack channel.

4. Email your ids for the various services to the mentor and to me.
Title your message "**{{ site.courseid }} {{ site.semester }}, {{
page.title }}: {{ page.subtitle }} (_Name_)**".  Please replace "_Name_"
with your name and do not include the quotation marks.

The content of the message should look something like the following
