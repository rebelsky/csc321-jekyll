============================

Read Chapter 11 of the Saasbook.

For the journal send an email message to me titled "**CSC 321 2017S,

with answers to the following questions.

1. In your own words, what is a design pattern? What is an antipattern?

2. What new design principle or pattern did you find most useful?

3. Which design principle or pattern did you find the most relevant to your prior experience with object-oriented programming? Explain the pattern and why you chose it.

4. Which design principle or pattern did you find the most confusing? Explain it as best you can and say where you got confused.
