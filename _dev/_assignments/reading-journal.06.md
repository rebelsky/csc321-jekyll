Reading journal for class 6
===========================

For the journal send an email message to me titled "**CSC 321 2017S, Journal
for Day 6 (*Your Name*)**" and with answers to the following questions.

1. Explain Ruby's `yield` operation as best you can.  (Yes, you may rely
on Web resources.)

2. What is something in the Chapter 3 reading that you'd like to discuss
in class on Friday?
