_Warning!  This assignment relies on Cloud 9.  Cloud 9 is in transition.
Please use the traditional Cloud 9, if possible.  At this point, you should
know about the primary differences.

## Your primary task

Do all of the exercises in [Chapter 5 of Michael Hartl's _The Rails
Tutorial](https://www.railstutorial.org/book/static_pages).  You will
then answer some questions on those steps.  You may find it useful to
read the questions in advance.

1. Please share your GitHub or Bitbucket repo with me. (My GitHub username
is `rebelsky` and my Bibucket username is either `rebelsky` or
`rebelsky@grinnell.edu`.

## What to submit

Send me answers to the following questions in a message entitled "**{{
site.courseid }} {{ site.semester }}, {{ page.title }}: {{ page.subtitle
}} (_Name_)**".  Please replace _Name_ with your name.

0. What is the URL of your Cloud 9 instance?  (E.g.,
`https://ide.c9.io/username/rails-tutorial`.)  I realize that you've
told me before, but it's easier to have it in this location.

1. What is the URL of your GitHub or BitBucket repo?

2. What is the URL of your Heroku application?

3. The suggested `README.md` refers to `LICENSE.md`.  Where does that
latter file come from?

_Remaining questions forthcoming!_
