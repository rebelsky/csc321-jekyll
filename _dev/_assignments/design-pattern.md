In class on Friday, you were assigned a design pattern.
design pattern in a form that will be useful for your fellow students.
In particular, you should provide examples of how the pattern might be
used in relevant programs in Scheme, Java, *and* Ruby.

While you may use the Interweb as a resource, rlease do not rely on 
examples you find on the Interweb.  Part of the assignment is for you
to generate your own examples.

You may work alone or you may work with other students assigned the same
pattern.
