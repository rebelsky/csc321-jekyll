Reading journal for class 17
============================

For the journal send an email message to me titled "**CSC 321 2017S,
Journal for Day 17 (*Your Name*)**" (without the quotation marks) and
with answers to the following questions.

1. What do you see as particular values of using UML?

2. Which form of UML strikes you as most useful?  Why?

3. What challenges do you see in using UML?  (That is, why might teams
choose not to use UML?)
