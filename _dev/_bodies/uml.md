The UML
-------

* The UML == The Unified Modeling Language
* A visual notation for representing key issues in the design of an
  object-oriented program.
* Observation: We like to communicate things visually.  But for a visual
  notation to work well, we have to agree upon what the symbols mean.
* Can be used prospectively or retrospectively
* Three traditional ways to think about the UML
  + We use the UML to _sketch out_ classes and their relationships
    while thinking about design.
  + We use the UML to _blueprint_ most of the details of a system.
  + We use the UML as a programming language to _implement_
    a system.
* Developed collaboratively by many of the big names in OOP in the
  early ages of the adoption of OOA&amp;D by industry.
* We'll focus mostly on it as a tool for sketching.
* That is, we'll use the UML to communicate important things about our 
  systems to each other, but we won't try to dot every t and cross every i.

UML: Class Notation
-------------------

What do we care about for classes?  Here are some possibilities
* The basic components of the class:
  + The fields
  + The methods
* The role of the class in the inheritance hierarchy
* The other classes that the class uses (implicitly)

We will need notations for each of these things.

We may find that we need other notations, too.
