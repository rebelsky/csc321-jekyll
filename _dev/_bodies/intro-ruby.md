Some Ruby Problems
------------------

Write `sums_to_n?(vals,val)` that returns true if any pair
of values from `vals` sums to `val`.

Write `multiple_of_4?(bitstring)` that takes a string of 0's and 1's
(representing an unsigned integer) as input and returns true if the
string represents an integer divisible by four.

Write `starts_with_consonant?(str)` that determines if a string
starts with a consonant.
