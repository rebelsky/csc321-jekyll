Professional Codes of Ethics
----------------------------

* Why?
* What?
* What else would you expect to see?
* Would you sign?
* How do we enforce?

Additional Issues
-----------------

A. There were some allusions to considering who has access to
computing-related products and education and the forms this access
takes, but I would have liked to see a more explicit treatment and an
acknowledgement that this status quo is not a static, natural phenomenon,
but one that is actively enforced and reproduced.

B. I like to think that coding is potentially one of the best ways to create
change in today's technological world for the better.

C. As I just had implicit bias training, it is cool to see that it is mentioned in the reading to not discriminate others through coding. 

D. About the entire ethics in computing thing, I think the primary point,
that software should contribute to society and well being is almost entire
ethics agnostic in the vast majority of cases. After all, I can think of
far more cases where someone as a developer would undermine society and
civil rights by working for a profitable firm than actually help tackle
some of the major issues of today.

E. I would appreciate discussing how we can start bringing some of these
practices more into our department and community. I enjoyed learning about
ethics in the context of software engineering and would be curious to see
how well professionals actually measure up to some of these standards. I
wish I had more time to dig into the material.

F.  I guess with regards to the second link, those are some very broad
concerns. Being the novices we are, how do we situate ourselves in
those problems? I agree that something like healthcare information is
very sensitive and should be protected, but although I might agree,
that doesn't seem very pragmatic.

G. I would like to discuss about encryption and if there are encryption
algorithms we can take advantage of in the ruby programming language.

H. I would like to discuss the idea of global surveillance and where to
draw the line.  It's a grey area for me and I'd like to get more opinions
on it.

I. In the "Computer Society and ACM Approve Software Engineering Code of
Ethics" reading, it seems to me that the idea about helping each other
in developing software is widely adopted by the open source community
but not some corporations.

J. I think most of the ethics code is basic courtesy. If you do a job for
someone, you obviously shouldnâ€™t half do it. When you create software,
you obviously should cite sources and where you got ideas from (as we
have been doing in Grinnell), and you should take responsibility for any
errors in your program and actively work towards making it better. It's
not just acting ethically, but it is being a good person and programmer.

K. Despite the fact that the second reading ends with the line "In
summary, without being a predictor of doom...", I'm now very vividly
feeling like we're all going to suffer a horrible catastrophe that
cripples our current society in the near future (approx 5-15 years). Not
a good feeling.

Ethics and Agile
----------------

* How do they cohere?
* How do they differ?
