What is Software Engineering?
-----------------------------

We should step back and ask ourselves the bigger question.  *What is
this thing, called "software engineering", that we are studying this
semester?

Why Study Software Engineering
------------------------------

We talked about this before, but it's probably useful to look at it again.

*Why are we studying it?  (Why do most institutions include it in their
curriculum?)*

More on Agile
-------------

A few things for us to talk about.

* Review: What practices did we mention last class?
* What are some advantages of agile?
* What are reasons that people would denegrate agile?

Web Technologies

Some Ruby-isms, Rails-isms, and More
-------------------------------------

### Ruby != Rails

In answering questions, some of you seemed to conflate Ruby and Rails.
Ruby is a general-purpose programming language.  Rails is a Web
application development infrastructure that happens to use Ruby for its
programming aspects.  (At least one of you also asked about HTML.)

### Syntax

The most difficult aspect of Ruby was digesting the syntax. 

### Refactoring

One of the aspects that I find the most confusing about Ruby is the
aspect that I also find fascinating. The ability to refactor code and
make it much more concise. I understand that most of the code in Ruby
can be made more concise than in other languages, but I do not know how
to do so as I am very new to the language and do not know many of the
ways to refactor. I would like to learn more about how I can rewrite
code so that it is still easily understandable, but much more concise.

### Migration

What is it exactly?  Why is it useful?

### Hard to parse

The calling of functions using left shift bitwise operators confused me
because I’m surprised why you just can’t call using function names
and just append the strings together using the ‘+’ operator.

### Metaprogramming

I don’t really understand how you can generate code at runtime yet
you write the code before you run the program. Is there a way to go to a
program that is already running and change the code and then the program
changes the way it executes.

The concept of metaprogramming is sort of difficult to understand. What
are some more examples of metaprogramming?

### Duck Typing

What is it?  How does it relate to key oop principles?

### `yield`

I am still working to understand what “yield” does. According to the
reading, yield is commonly used with iterators. Once in the scope of the
iterator, code is executed until it reaches yield.  Then, any arguments
given to yield are then used as arguments in the block of the iterator. I
still do not understand why this is more or less useful to program with.

### Scaffolding

Scaffolding continues to confuse me, though I'm slightly less confused
as to why it's a good teaching tool.

### Mix-Ins

I think I understand in a broad sense how mix-ins work, but I’m fuzzy
on how they work syntactically in code. I’m not sure I would recognize
them if I was looking at a program that used them. I understand that
modules are included using the keyword include, but I’m not sure where
mix-ins are included in Ruby code. I’m also not sure how yield works,
even though it seems pretty intuitive, I’m just not sure if I would
be sure when to use it.
