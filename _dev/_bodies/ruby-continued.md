A brief introduction to Ruby
----------------------------

* Modern programming language.
* "One" designer.
* Imperative, functional, and OOP characteristics.
* Good at "Get the job done quickly."
* Very dynamic.
* Very popular.
* Everything (more or less) is an object.
* Includes anonymous functions, although with a different syntax than
  we might expect.
* Disadvantage: Too many ways to express the same concept.

    if TEST consequent
    consequent if TEST
    if TEST
      consequent
    end
    unless not TEST
      consquent
    end
    consequent unless not TEST

Some Ruby exercises
-------------------

*We will explore some of the examples from today's assignment to see
the different ways in which students approached problems.*

Write `sums_to_n?(vals,val)` that returns true if any two distinct
values from `vals` (a list of values) sums to `val`.

Write `multiple_of_4?(bitstring)` that takes a string of 0's and 1's
(representing an unsigned integer) as input and returns true if the
string represents an integer divisible by four.

Write `starts_with_consonant?(str)` that determines if a string
starts with a consonant.
