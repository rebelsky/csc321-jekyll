Data Modeling
-------------

* How do we generally model data in these kinds of applications?
  (Conceptually, rather than what code do we use.)
* We normally say that we use a "relational" model.  What does
  "relation" mean  here?
* What general kinds of relationships are there between relations?
  (and what are examples of each)?
* Why do we use a DBMS rather than managing things by ourselves?

An Exercise
-----------

* LibraryThing is a shared "keep track of my books" SaaS.
* For LibraryThing, what relations (tables) do you see
  as useful?  How do you represent them?
