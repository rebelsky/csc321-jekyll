Design Patterns
---------------

* Inspired by C. Alexander's work on Architecture, *A Pattern Language*.
* Leading OO-programmers/designers looked at common software architecture
  tasks/problems and came up with a taxonomy of common solutions to those
  problems.
* Valuable in (at least) two ways
    * For novice programmers, provides better approaches to
      tasks that they don't realize are old.
    * For experienced programmers, provides a language to talk about
      approaches.
* There are growing movements to write "patterns" (and "anti-patterns")
  for many different classes of problems.  There are even teaching
  patterns.
* Most folks at Grinnell believe that you apply patterns loosely; they are
  intended as a way to help you think and communicate, rather than strict 
  strategies.
