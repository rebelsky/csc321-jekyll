Accessibility of Web pages
==========================

As I note in [my statement on students with
disabilities](../handouts/disabilities.html), I do what I can to
accommodate students who need different kinds of support.  In part,
I do so by trying to keep my Web pages accessible.  (I include a link
to WAVE on the bottom of each page to as way to remind myself to check.)

Like the broader Grinnell College community, I am committed to providing
a site that a broad audience can access, regardless of technology
or ability.  The College provides a [more detailed statement about these
issues](https://www.grinnell.edu/accessibility-statement).

If you would like additional assistance or have
accessibility concerns, please contact the [Office of
Communications](mailto:communications@grinnell.edu) at 641-269-3400.
If you have particular concerns about my site, please contact me 
at [rebelsky@grinnell.edu](mailto:rebelsky@grinnell.edu?subject=Accessibility Issue With Web Site).
