### An atypical start to class.

* Welcome back!
* We have a guest speaker today.  I'll give the class to her and then
  resume when she finishes.

### News / Etc.

* Welcome back!  I think I know most of you, and I'm happy to be able to
  teach you again.
    * But I will still take attendance.
* As seems to be the case way too often, the course Web site is not quite
  in the state I'd like.  Cross your fingers that it will be working 
  better soon.

### Upcoming Work

* [Sign up for way too many accounts](../assignments/accounts), due Tuesday.
* [Learn some Ruby](../assignments/getting-started-with-ruby), also due
  Tuesday.

### Good things to do

#### Academic

* First-year convocation today at 11:00 a.m.
* CS Table next Tuesday (unknown topic).
* CS Extras next Thursday (unknown topic).

#### Peer

* ???
