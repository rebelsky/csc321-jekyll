### News and notes

* Mentor session ?-? Sunday night
    * KY recommends that you start the homework in advance.
* Alumni mentors visit next Wednesday.  Please try to clear lunch time,
  4pm for their talk, (and 1pm, if possible).
* The homework has clearly been too long.  I've allocated class time for
  discussing the issue(s).

### Upcoming work

  Thursday at 9:00pm.
