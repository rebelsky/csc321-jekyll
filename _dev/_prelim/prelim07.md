### News and notes

* Mentor session 8-9 Tuesday night
    * KY recommends that you start the homework in advance.
* My weekend evaporated.  I'm still a bit behind on grading.  Sorry.
* Unfortunately, the solution to some of your problems will sometimes 
  be the equivalent of "reboot".  For example, a student who was having
  trouble with Heroku found it easiest to just set up a new Heroku
  instance.
