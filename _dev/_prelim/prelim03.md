### Admin

* Take a playing card.  It will determine where you sit in class.
    * Why?  I want you to practice discussing things with other
      people.
* Please ask your homework questions on the Slack #homework channel.
* Please take the journals seriously.
    * Correct grammar and spelling.
    * Thoughtful responses.
    * On the last question, "Explain it in your own words" means 
      "explain the concept" not just "explain your confusion".
    * Example: "I did not fully understand the differences in the different types of testing described on page 70 e.g BlackBox Testing, Regression Testing, etc. The descriptions in the book aren't very informative and hard to understand."
        * Page number: Great!
        * e.g., ... etc.: Shows carelessness.
        * Does not attempt to explain.
* Your mentor will be offering one-hour mentor sessions the night 
  assignments are due.
