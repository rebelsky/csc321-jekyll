### News and notes

* Alumni mentors visit next Wednesday.  Please try to clear lunch time,
  4pm for their talk, (and 1pm, if possible).
* I have not yet had time to rearrange the schedule.  I'm currently trying
  to figure out when my first free moment will be.

### Upcoming work

* [Hartl 5](../assignments/hartl-5) due **Tuesday** at 10:30pm.
    * Extend by two days.  Please break up your work.
    * I need to find a three-hour block to write that assignment.
    * Python people should find an alternative.
    * You will have time to work on it on Monday.

### Good things to do (Academic/Artistic)

* Rosenfield symposium this week
* MET opera on Saturday.
* Contra dance Friday at 8pm in Younker Lounge.  Live music!
* Two cool shows in the Faulconer.
* Islam week events next week (details forthcoming)
