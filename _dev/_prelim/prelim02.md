### Admin

* Please ask your homework questions on the Slack #homework channel.
* Some of you are getting check-minus grades on the assignment.  
    * For assignments, that will still count as a 90.  (You should not 
      get lower than the timebox value, provided that it's clear that
      you've put in an appropriate level of effort and time.)
    * For journals, that will count lower.
* Today is the last day to fill out the data buddies survey
  <https://cerp.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_3UH7q6TmdZ8YRPD>.
  Surveys are more meaningful if we get higher participation.

### Upcoming work

* [Learn Ruby](../assignments/ruby-codecademy) (Due 10:30 pm last night)
    * The three of you who neither submitted it nor submitted a note 
      explaining why it was late will receive late grades.

  (Due 9:00pm THURSDAY)
