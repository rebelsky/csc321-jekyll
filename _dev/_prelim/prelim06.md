### Admin

* Mentor session Sunday and Tuesday night
* How long did Hartl 1 take?
    * Observation: When things go right, it's reasonable.  But when things
      go wrong, it's really hard to figure out why.
* The Friday PSA will happen in CSC 322

### Upcoming work

    * The response part of this assignment will not be available until
