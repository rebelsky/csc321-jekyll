### Admin

* *Welcome back!*  I think I know most of you, and I'm happy to be able to
  teach you again.
* But I'm still taking attendance.
* The course site for CSC 321 may be more ready than it's ever been.
  Cross your fingers that it stays that way.  Let me know when things
  don't work.  
    * For example, we had a configuration screwup that made some pages
      unavailable.  Let me know if you find such pages.
* There will probably not be a separate CSC 322 next year.  If you 
  are taking CSC 321 this semester, please enroll in CSC 322.
* Please fill out the Data Buddies survey that you received over break.
  <https://cerp.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_3UH7q6TmdZ8YRPD>.
  Surveys are more meaningful if we get higher participation.
* After today, I'll plan to have a cart of laptops in this classroom.
