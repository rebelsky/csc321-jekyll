### Admin

* *Welcome back!*  I think I know most of you, and I'm happy to be able to
  teach you again.
* But I'm still taking attendance.
* CS Table Tuesday!  (I hope.)
* CS Extras Thursday: Research opportunities at Grinnell.
* The course site for CSC 321 may be more ready than it's ever been.
  Cross your fingers that it stays that way.  Let me know when things
  don't work.
* There may not be a separate CSC 322 next semester.  If you are taking
  CSC 321, please enroll in CSC 322.
* Please fill out the Data Buddies survey that you received over break.

  Surveys are more meaningful if we get higher participation.
