### News / Etc.

* I think I've been off by one on the reading journal numbers.  Apologies.
  That issue is now fixed.
* I've added a week to the due date to the introductory rails assignment.
* Please let me know when you notice problems on the Web site.  I think 
  I've fixed most of them.

### Upcoming Work

* Programming assignment: [Intro rails](../assignments/getting-started-with-rails) (due Tuesday the 19 at 10:30 p.m.)
