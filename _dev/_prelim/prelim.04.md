### News / Etc.

* Reflections should generally be submitted by 9pm on Sunday night 
  so that I can read them before class.
* In general, I'll have you start on the Hartl on your own and we'll
  work on finishing it up during class.
* Don't be afraid to ask for help!  (From me, from your classmates, from
  Adam, from the Interweb.)
