### News / Etc.

* Apologies for the late start today.
* Please let me know when you notice problems on the Web site.  I think 
  I've fixed most of them.  (Okay, something is massively wrong with the
  generation of readings in the schedule, but that turns out to be a programming
  problem I don't have time to address.)

### Upcoming Work

* [Reading journal for class 12](../readings/legacy) due Monday night.
* [The last programming project](../assignments/last-project) to be
  posted tonight, due a week from Tuesday.

### Good things to do

_Note: I do not do extra credit in two-credit classes._

#### Academic

* Convocation today.
* CS table Tesday
* CS extras Thursday
