### News / Etc.

* Welcome to day two of CSC 321!  
* Yes, I will take attendance.
* Today and Thursday, we will continue to explore the wonders of Ruby.
* Your mentor will be giving up some class time to have evening mentor
  sessions (increasingly so as the first half of the semester continues).
* I'm still working on the course Web site.
* Yes, I know the assignments were time-consuming.  But we want you to
  practice getting up to speed quickly.  I'm limiting the work for
  Thursday.
* Some concerns and comments
    * If I'm going to use your reading journals to prepare class,
      I really do need them in on time.  (That's my fault for not giving
      a clear due time.)  They will be due at 8 p.m.
    * When I write "Email your ids for the various services to *the mentor* 
      and to me", that means you should send it to both of us.
    * Please follow the instructions for giving titles to email messages.
      You should know why.
