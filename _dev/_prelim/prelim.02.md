### News / Etc.

* We now have a schedule in place.  The rest of the syllabus should be
  there tonight.
* I lied.  Most students last year said they took 4-5 hours for the
  Ruby tutorial.  That means I've used about half of your homework time
  for this week (assuming that you got through everything).

### Homework

* [More Ruby](../assignments/ruby-intro-continued)
* [Reading journal](../assignments/reading-journal-03)
